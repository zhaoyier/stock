      <p>
        <p>Setting clear buyer expectations and meeting or exceeding them is a great way to make your buyers happy and ensure smooth transactions.</p>
        <p>Some of the simplest things you can do are to provide accurate and consistent details about your item and to be clear and specific about the terms and conditions of your sale.</p>
        <p>You should also make every effort to provide excellent customer service from start to finish, including:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
          <li className="initial">Charging reasonable shipping and handling costs</li>
          <li className="initial">Specifying your handling time and return policy in your listing</li>
